Use this program to check if the input file(s) has any duplicate rows.

## Getting started
Once we create big file(s) and someone asks to verify if there are any duplicate rows then that is where we can make use of this program. This program will not only checks for the duplicate rows, it also creates a file without any duplicates. Apart from this it also creates another file with only the duplicate rows in it.
